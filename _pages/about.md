Hi, thanks for visiting!  
My name is Tony Stark,   
Genius, Billionaire, Philanthropist,... (I wish, and might be actually some day)!  
I am Shubham Mawa, I work in Mercedes-Benz Research and Development India in the field of Computer Vision and Artificial Intelligence. I graduated from IIT Kharagpur with a dual degree, B.Tech and M.Tech in Industrial and Systems Engineering.  

I read, I write, I code, and I also play football!  

I am interested in understanding intelligence, human and artificial.
