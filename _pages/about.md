Hi,  
I am Shubham Mawa, I work in Mercedes-Benz Research and Development India in the field of Computer Vision and Artificial Intelligence. I graduated from IIT Kharagpur with a dual degree, B.Tech and M.Tech in Industrial and Systems Engineering.  

I read, I write, I code, and I also play football!  

Intelligence piques my interest, be it human or artificial.
